# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the metadata.
3. Loads both the training and test datasets.
4. Loads the activity and subject data.
5. Merges the two sets of data.
6. Generates factors
7. Generates final dataset.

The end result is shown in the file `tidy.txt`.
